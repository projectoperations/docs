# Update considerations

The upgrade page provides instructions on how to upgrade your Coder deployment.
This article, however, includes information you should be aware of prior to
upgrading, such as architecture updates and breaking changes.

## Upgrading to v1.30

- Versions `1.30` and above include a database migration that changes string-based
  IDs to PostgreSQL UUIDs.

## Upgrading to v1.29

Previously, Coder applied a `UNIQUE` constraint to usernames, but only the
case-sensitive form (not the lowercase username). This release changes the
constraint so that it also applies to the lowercase form of the username and
ensures that all users have unique, lowercase usernames.

If there are multiple usernames where the only differences are the casing, the
duplicates will be renamed as follows:

- Sort each group of usernames (e.g., username, Username, UserName) by its
  case-sensitive form
- The first username remains untouched; Coder appends a number to subsequent
  usernames (e.g., Username2, UserName3)

This means that any usernames that are already lowercase remain unchanged, since
they will be first in the sort group.

## Upgrading from v1.25 to v1.26

- Beginning with `1.26`, Coder requires the use of Kubernetes `1.20` or later.
  See Coder's [version support policy] for more information.

- Coder supports the use of Markdown formatting in system and service banners.
  Coder now renders the Markdown content in existing banners, instead of
  displaying the raw Markdown syntax.

- Coder has made the dark theme generally available. Users who have enabled the
  beta version via feature flag will need to re-enable this; Coder won't
  auto-apply the theme.

## Upgrading from v1.24 to v1.25

- In 1.25, dev URLs use double dashes `--` as delimiters, instead of single
  dashes `-`. Please update bookmarks accordingly.

- v1.25 updates the username format to allow the use of alphanumeric character
  and hyphens. The length of the username can be 1-39 characters, inclusive.

## Upgrading from versions prior to v1.21

Users upgrading deployments that predate the release of v1.21 to v1.21 or later
should update their Helm values file to reflect Coder's [updated schema]. More
specifically, users must change the following values:

- `cemanager` --> `coderd`
- `cemanager.replicas` --> `coderd.replicas`
- `cemanager.image` --> `coderd.image`
- `cemanager.resources` --> `coderd.resources`
- `devurls.host` --> `coderd.devurlsHost`
- `ingress.loadBalancerIP` --> `coderd.serviceSpec.loadBalancerIP`
- `ingress.loadBalancerSourceRanges` -->
  `coderd.serviceSpec.loadBalancerSourceRanges`
- `ingress.service.externalTrafficPolicy` -->
  `coderd.serviceSpec.externalTrafficPolicy`
- `ingress.tls.hostSecretName` --> `coderd.tls.hostSecretName`
- `ingress.tls.devurlsHostSecretName` --> `coderd.tls.devurlsHostSecretName`
- `storageClassName` --> `postgres.default.storageClassName`
- `timescale.image` --> `postgres.default.image`
- `timescale.resources` --> `postgres.default.resources`
- `timescale.resources.requests.storage` -->
  `postgres.default.resources.requests.storage`
- `postgres.useDefault` --> `postgres.default.enable`
- `deploymentAnnotations` --> `services.annotations`
- `serviceTolerations` --> `services.tolerations`
- `clusterDomainSuffix` --> `services.clusterDomainSuffix`
- `serviceType` --> `services.type`
- `serviceAccount.annotations` -->
  `coderd.builtinProviderServiceAccount.annotations`
- `serviceAccount.labels` --> `coderd.builtinProviderServiceAccount.labels`
