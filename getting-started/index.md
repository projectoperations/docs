# Getting started

Weâ€™re excited for you to be part of the growing community of Coder users, and we
wanted to provide this onboarding guide to help you get started.

If you've been tasked with deploying and configuring Coder, please see our
[admin](admin.md) guide for a high-level overview of what you need to do so that
your developers can create their workspaces and begin working on their projects.

There are two primary ways of deploying Coder, and we offer developer-oriented
guides for both [Kubernetes deployments](developers.md) and
[deployments using Coder for Docker](docker.md). Once developers have a Coder
deployment available to them, these end-to-end guides will walk them through
logging in and getting set up with a sample project they can use to experience
Coder.

Additionally, we have a guide for those interested in leveraging Coder for
[data science](data-scientists.md), specifically using Python with Jupyter
notebooks. We also have a tutorial on getting started with [PyCharm](pycharm.md)
and [IntelliJ](intellij.md).
