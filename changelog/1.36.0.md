### Known Issues ‚ÑπÔ∏è

- On AWS EKS, cached CVMs are known to not work with more recent versions of the
  `Ubuntu2004` AMI family that include kernel version `5.15-aws`. Workaround:
  roll back to a version that includes an earlier kernel version (for example,
  `ubuntu-eks/k8s_1.22/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-20220706`)
  or build a custom AMI with the generic kernel.
