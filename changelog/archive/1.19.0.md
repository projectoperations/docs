# 1.19.0

### Breaking changes ‚ùó

- infra: Workspace assets created by Coder that were previously located at
  `/opt/coder`, such as code-server and coder-cli, have been moved to
  `/var/tmp/coder`
- infra: Workspace templates have been updated from version _0.1_ to _0.2_.
  Existing workspaces using version _0.1_ templates can be rebuilt, but no new
  workspaces can be created using the old format.
- web: The workspace templates _Open in Coder_ embeddable button flow no longer
  includes a _clone_ step; buttons created from prior versions will still work,
  but Coder will not clone the project. To automate project cloning, use
  [`workspace.configure.start`](../workspaces/workspace-templates/templates.md#workspaceconfigurestart)
- web: The embedded form for workspace templates located at **Manage** >
  **Admin** > **Templates** no longer uses the following fields: **Project
  Repository URL** and **Project Git Service**

  maximum resource utilization allowable for each member within an organization
  for which such quotas are enabled. Modify them at **Manage** >
  **Organizations** > **Edit Organization**

  dormant. The reactivation step requires the user to agree to use a license
  seat

  across all workspaces within the deployment. Modify the maximum dev URL access
  level at **Manage** > **Admin** > **Infrastructure** in the card titled **Dev
  URL Access Permissions**

  environment (if CVMs are enabled at the site level)

  (IdP) during sign-in

  control plane containers to support OpenShift `anyuid`
