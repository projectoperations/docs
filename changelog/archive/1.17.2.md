  fail.

  (IdPs) that omit name information, such as GitLab. In this case, Coder will
  use the email address as the user's name.

  environment name may have caused build errors.
- web: The dev URLs card on the **Environments** page now refreshes after an
  environment finishes building.

  always run. They now start on request when opening JetBrains IDEs.
