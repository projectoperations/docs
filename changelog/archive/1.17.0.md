# 1.17.0

### Breaking changes ‚ùó

- helm: The `namespaceWhitelist` field on the Coder helm charts has been removed
  and the organization namespaces feature has been deprecated.
  - Deployments that had this value set cannot add namespaces, and cannot remove
    namespaces unless there are no environments still using them
  - Existing environments in whitelisted namespaces will continue to work
  - Environments cannot be created in whitelisted namespaces any longer
  - Organizations can't be removed from a workspace provider (see below) until
    all environments in that organization _and_ workspace provider are deleted.
    Users in an organization can create environments in the built-in workspace
    provider until _all_ environments in that provider are deleted and the
    organization is removed from the whitelist.

### Features ‚ú®

- Workspace Providers: Workspace providers enable a single Coder deployment to
  provision and manage workspaces across multiple Kubernetes clusters and
  namespaces.

    **Workspace Providers**

    Environment modals

    namespaces

  starts and builds your environments.

  - web: New onboarding wizard available for setting a preferred Autostart time.
  - web: New configuration page available via **Account Preferences** >

    Edit Environment** modals.

### Bug fixes üêõ

- web: Fixed dormant accounts and accounts pending deletion not displaying
  correctly in the **Manage > Users** table
- web: Fixed DevURL error page links using incorrect URIs.
- infra: Fixed timeout when deleting users with many environments
- infra: Increased offline timeout in trial versions of Coder
- web: Fixed casing when referencing 'GitHub' and 'GitLab'
- infra: Fixed an issue whereby renaming an OAuth provider caused a duplicate to
  be created. Migrating to 1.17.0 will remove these duplicates. They are not
  visible in the UI.
- infra: Corrected environment statuses during build and shutdown states
- web: Fixed SiteAdmin users receiving a notification that their SSH keys are
  out of sync after creating an initial environment.
  - Note: We do not recommend using the SiteAdmin user beyond the initial setup

### Security updates üîê

- When resetting the SiteAdmin password using the
  `cemanager reset-admin-password` tool, Coder requires a new password to be set
  upon next login (the initial password provided is marked as a temporary
  password).
