### Known issues 🔧

- web: the service banner (if enabled) reappears for all users, even if they've
  previously dismissed it.
- web: using the web terminal in Coder can occasionally result in the connection
  being reset and needing to be restarted.
- web: the **Switch workspace** drop-down menu shows a workspace's status as
  **Building** even though the build process is completed.
- web: users upgrading to v1.24 (or later) into an air-gapped environment cannot
  upload their license when prompted.
- web: by default, Coder workspace builds are self-contained; as such, images
  that do _not_ contain `curl` will result in the workspace failing to build.
