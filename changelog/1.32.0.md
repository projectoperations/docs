### Security updates üîê

  for XSS attacks.

### Known issues üîß

- web: the service banner (if enabled) reappears for all users, even if they've
  previously dismissed it.

  that do _not_ contain `curl` will result in the workspace failing to build.

  installed Projector version in this release.
