# Progressive web apps

In addition to running Coder in a web browser, you can also run each application
as a progressive web application (PWA). Using Coder as a PWA offers you an
experience akin to a native application and improved performance.

## Requirements

To use Coder as a PWA, you must connect to Coder over HTTPS and use either
Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.

## Installing the PWA

1. Log into Coder and select your workspace.
1. Under **Applications**, click on an application to launch it as a new window
   or tab.
1. Follow your browser's instructions for installing the application as a
   [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361) or a
   [Microsoft Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/ux#installing-a-pwa)
   PWA.

Please note that applications are currently installed on a per-workspace basis.
