# Editors and IDEs

There are several primary ways you can connect an IDE to your Coder workspace:

1. [VS Code remote SSH](editors.md#vs-code-remote-ssh) with local VS Code
1. [VS Code in the browser](editors.md#vs-code-in-the-browser) with code-server
1. [JetBrains Gateway and SSH](editors.md#jetbrains-gateway-with-ssh)
1. [JetBrains in the browser](editors.md#jetbrains-ides-in-the-browser) with
   JetBrains Projector
1. [JetBrains' Code With Me](editors.md#code-with-me)
1. [Multiple JetBrains IDEs](editors.md#multiple-jetbrains-ides)
1. [Jupyter Notebook](editors.md#jupyter-notebook)
1. [JupyterLab](editors.md#jupyterlab)
1. [RStudio](editors.md#rstudio)
1. _Any_ local editor with
   [1-way file synchronization](../cli/file-sync.md#one-way-file-sync) or
   [2-way file synchronization over SSH](../cli/file-sync.md#two-way-file-sync)

## VS Code remote SSH

Once you've [set up SSH access to Coder](./ssh.md), you can work on projects
from your local VS Code, connected to your Coder workspace for compute, etc.

1. Open VS Code locally.
1. Make sure that you've installed
   [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)
   extension
1. In VS Code's left-hand nav bar, click **Remote Explorer** and right-click on
   a workspace to connect

![VS Code Remote Explorer](../assets/workspaces/vscode-remote-ssh-panel.png)

## VS Code in the browser

Launch VS Code in the browser from the workspaces page by clicking the _Code
Web_ icon.

![Launch a workspace](../assets/workspaces/code-web-app.png)

> Code Web is Coder's open-source project
> [code-server](https://coder.com/docs/code-server/latest).

### Opening files via the terminal

You can open files from your Coder workspace in VS Code via the terminal. We
recommend creating an alias to the underlying code-server executable so that you
can use the command `code` for this process:

```console
alias code="/var/tmp/coder/code-server/bin/code-server -r"
```

Then, to open a file (e.g., `personalize.log`):

```console
code personalize.log
```

Alternatively, if you would like to use just the code-server executable, add it
to your `PATH`:

```console
export PATH=$PATH:/var/tmp/coder/code-server/bin
```

Then, to open a file (e.g., `personalize.log`):

```text
code-server -r personalize.log
```

> If you're using Coder's web terminal, make sure that you've opened a Code Web
> session. If, however, you're using the web IDE's terminal, the file contents
> will appear in the IDE.

## JetBrains Gateway with SSH

If your image
[includes a JetBrains IDE](../admin/workspace-management/installing-jetbrains.md)
and you've [set up SSH access to Coder](./ssh.md), you can use JetBrains Gateway
to run a local JetBrains IDE connected to your Coder workspace.

Please note that:

- Your Coder workspace must be running. Gateway needs compute resources, so
  monitor your resource usage on the Coder dashboard and adjust accordingly.
- If you use a premium JetBrains IDE (e.g., GoLand, IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate), you
  will still need a license to use it remotely with Coder.

1. [Download and install JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/).
   Locate JetBrains Gateway in the Toolbox list and click **Install**.

   ![JetBrains Toolbox](../assets/workspaces/jetbrains-toolbox.png)

1. Open JetBrains Gateway and click **Connect via SSH** within the **Run the IDE
   Remotely** section.

   ![Open JetBrains Gateway](../assets/workspaces/gateway-opened.png)

1. Click the small **gear icon** to the right of the **Connection** field, then
   the **+** button on the next screen to create a new configuration.

   ![Connect Gateway to SSH](../assets/workspaces/gateway-connect-to-ssh.png)

1. Enter your Coder workspace alias target in **Host** (e.g.,
   `coder.mark-python`), `22` in **Port**, `coder` in **User name**, and change
   **Authentication Type** to **OpenSSH config and authentication agent**. Leave
   the local port field blank. Click **Test Connection**.

   ![Gateway SSH Configurations](../assets/workspaces/gateway-ssh-configurations.png)

1. With your created configuration in the **Connection** chosen in the drop-down
   field, click **Test Connection**, then **OK**.

   ![Test Gateway Connection](../assets/workspaces/gateway-test-connection.png)

1. Select a JetBrains IDE from the IDE version drop-down. Choose the IDE
   installed in your Coder workspace, and click the folder icon and select your
   `/home/coder` directory in your Coder workspace.

   ![Select JetBrains IDE and working directory](../assets/workspaces/gateway-ide-and-project.png)

1. During this installation step, Gateway downloads the IDE and a JetBrains
   client. This may take a couple minutes.

   ![Gateway downloading IDE and client](../assets/workspaces/gateway-download-client.png)

   ![Code with Me starting up](../assets/workspaces/gateway-code-with-me-loading.png)

   ![A running JetBrains IDE in Gateway](../assets/workspaces/gateway-ide-running.png)

> If your Coder deployment is configured with ECDSA ssh key algorithm, change
> the Gateway authentication type to **Key pair** and create the Coder public
> ssh key in your local `~/.ssh` directory with `ssh-keygen -y -f`:
>
> `~/.ssh/coder_enterprise | tee ~/.ssh/coder_enterprise.pub`

## JetBrains IDEs in the browser

Coder uses an open-source project called Projector, created and managed by
JetBrains, to render a JetBrains IDE in a browser.

If your image
[includes a JetBrains IDE](../admin/workspace-management/installing-jetbrains.md)
(such as IntelliJ, PyCharm, and PhpStorm), you can launch it from the dashboard.

![IntelliJ logos](../assets/workspaces/intellij-app.png)

Coder launches JetBrains IDEs in their own windows; be sure to set your browser
to allow popup windows so that you can use your IDE.

> Follow these steps to
> [start a trial or activate your paid JetBrains license](../guides/troubleshooting/activate-jetbrains-licensing.md).

### Installing JetBrains' IDEs

You install JetBrains IDEs in a Dockerfile, add the required packages to run
JetBrains in a browser, and create a symlink with one of the following names so
Coder can auto-detect the IDE and display the icon in the workspace.

Using Docker, you `docker build` the image from the Dockerfile. You then push
the image to your container registry and import the image into your Coder
deployment.

Your administrator can
[follow these steps to build the JetBrains IDE image](../admin/workspace-management/installing-jetbrains.md).

The symlink names supported by Coder are:

- `clion`
- `datagrip`
- `dataspell`
- `goland`
- `intellij-idea-ultimate`
- `intellij-idea-community`
- `phpstorm`
- `pycharm`
- `pycharm-community`
- `rider`
- `rubymine`
- `studio` (Android Studio)
- `webstorm`

## System requirements

The resources required depends on your workspace-specific requirements. We
recommend reviewing the documentation for your IDE to obtain a starting point.

### Known issues

- Window dragging behavior can misalign with mouse movements
- Popover dialogs do not always appear in the correct location
- Popup windows are missing titles and window controls
- Some theme-based plugins can cause the IDE to render incorrectly
- Some minor rendering artifacts occur during regular usage
- Keyboard shortcuts being overridden by the browser. Try
  [running JetBrains as a Progressive Web App](./pwa.md) to regain shortcuts.

## Code With Me

[JetBrains' Code With Me](https://www.jetbrains.com/code-with-me/) allows you to
collaborate with others in real-time on your project and enables pair
programming.

> You must have a
> [JetBrains IDE installed](../admin/workspace-management/installing-jetbrains.md)
> in your [image](../images/index.md) to start a Code With Me session from your
> Coder workspace. Only the workspace where the source code is being worked on
> needs JetBrains; other collaborators do _not_ need a JetBrains IDE.

### Getting started

To set up a Code With Me session:

1. The host creates a session and shares the information needed to join the
   session with other participants.
1. The participants use the information provided by the host to join the session
   and request access.
1. The host accepts the participants' request to join the session created by the
   host.

#### Step 1: Start and host a session

To create and host a Code With Me session:

1. Log in to Coder.

1. Under **Browser Applications**, launch the JetBrains IDE (e.g., IntelliJ
   PyCharm) of your choice.

   ![Launch IDE](../assets/workspaces/pycharm-app.png)

1. Click the **Code With Me** icon at the top of your IDE.

   ![Code With Me icon](../assets/workspaces/code-with-me-2.png)

1. Select **Enable Access and Copy Invitation Link...**.

   ![Enable access and copy link](../assets/workspaces/code-with-me-3.png)

1. Confirm and accept the Terms of Use.

1. Set the permissions for new guests to **Full access** and uncheck the
   **Automatically start voice call** feature. Click **Enable Access**.

1. Once you've enabled access, JetBrains copies the link you must share with
   participants to your clipboard. Send this link to those with whom you'd like
   to collaborate.

   You can recopy this link at any time by clicking the **Code With Me icon**
   and choosing **Copy Invitation Link...**.

   ![Link confirmation](../assets/workspaces/code-with-me-5.png)

#### Step 2: Request to join the session

If you've received a link to join a Code With Me session as a participant:

1. Copy the Code With Me session link that you were provided, and paste it into
   your web browser. You'll be directed to a webpage with further instructions.

1. On the instructions page to which you were directed, copy the code snippet
   and run it in the terminal.

   ![Run join command](../assets/workspaces/code-with-me-4.png)

1. Confirm and accept the User Agreement.

1. You'll be shown a **security code**. Verify with the host of your session
   that they see the same code.

   ![Security code verification](../assets/workspaces/code-with-me-7.png)

1. Wait for your host to accept your request to join; when they do, your
   JetBrains IDE will launch automatically.

   ![New JetBrains IDE](../assets/workspaces/code-with-me-8.png)

#### Step 3: Accept the request to the join

If you're the host of the session, you'll see a request that the other
participant wants to join your project, the permissions you've granted to the
other user, and a security code.

![Security code verification for host](../assets/workspaces/code-with-me-9.png)

Verify that the security code you see matches the one shown to your
participants. If they do, click **Accept** to proceed.

At this point, you'll be able to share your project and work with your partner
in real-time.

## Multiple JetBrains IDEs

If you'd like to have multiple projects open, you'll need to have multiple
JetBrains IDEs open in Coder simultaneously. The following steps show you how to
configure Coder to enable this behavior.

![Multiple IntelliJ icons in a workspace](../assets/workspaces/multi-intellij-icons-smaller.png)

Running multiple instances of the same JetBrains IDE requires you to create a
custom image and configure script to install the JetBrains Projector CLI using a
custom image and [configure](../images/configure.md) script.

The configure script will install JetBrains Projector, then use the Projector
CLI to install as many additional IDE instances as you need. Coder's
[workspace applications](./applications.md) feature surfaces the additional IDE
icons in the workspace.

We have provided
[detailed configuration steps](../guides/customization/multiple-jetbrains-ides.md)
for setting up your custom image and configure script.

## Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is the original web IDE for creating Notebooks used in data
science, machine learning and analytics projects. By default, any Coder
workspace with the Jupyter project installed (in `/usr/local/bin/jupyter`)
will render the icon to launch Jupyter Notebook.

![Jupyter Notework](../assets/workspaces/jupyter-notebook-icon.png)

To use Jupyter Notebook in a Coder workspace, build a Dockerfile with Jupyter
project installed as shown below:

```Dockerfile
# Dockerfile to install Jupyter Notebook
FROM codercom/enterprise-base:ubuntu

USER root

RUN pip3 install jupyter notebook

USER coder
```

## JupyterLab

JupyterLab is the next-generation web-based IDE for data science and Python
using documents called Notebooks.

![JupyterLab](../assets/workspaces/jupyterlab-opened.png)

There are three methods to install and access JupyterLab in Coder. All require
JupyterLab to be installed in the Dockerfile via `pip3 install jupyterlab`.

The first method renames the `jupyter` binary and copies a new `jupyter` that
adjusts the arguments passed to the `jupyter` binary to tell Coder to launch
JupyterLab instead of Notebook.

```Dockerfile
FROM codercom/enterprise-base:ubuntu

USER root

RUN pip3 install jupyterlab
RUN pip3 install jupyter notebook

RUN mv /usr/local/bin/jupyter /usr/local/bin/jupyter.py

COPY jupyter /usr/local/bin/jupyter

USER coder
```

Below is an example `jupyter` script with the lab arguments. This file must
be located in the same directory as the Dockerfile to be copied during `docker build`

```sh
#!/bin/bash
# Replace all "NotebookApp" settings with ServerApp settings.
args=${@//LabApp/"ServerApp"}
# Replace 'notebook' with 'lab' to launch juypter lab
args=${args/notebook/"lab"}

jupyter.py ${args}
```

The second method to run JupyterLab is with a dev URL and launching
JupyterLab via `supervisord` in the `configure` script. The benefit of this
approach is it is completely independent of Coder's IDE launching mechanism
and relies only on a generic dev URL.

![JupyterLab as a dev URL](../assets/workspaces/jupyterlab-as-devurl.png)

```Dockerfile
FROM codercom/enterprise-base:ubuntu

USER root

RUN pip3 install jupyterlab
RUN pip3 install jupyter notebook

# configure script to create a dev URL and launch JupyterLab
COPY ["configure", "/coder/configure"]
RUN chmod +x /coder/configure

# install supervisord
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y supervisor
RUN mkdir -p /var/log/supervisor
COPY supervisord.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisord.conf

# change back to the coder user
USER coder
```

The `configure` script installs `supervisord`

```sh
#!/bin/bash

echo 'create dev URL for JupyterLab'
coder urls create $CODER_WORKSPACE_NAME 8888 --name jupyterlab

echo 'start supervisord and JupyterLab'
sudo /usr/bin/supervisord
```

The `supervisord.conf` launches JupyterLab. This file must be located in the
same directory as the Dockerfile to be copied during `docker build`

```sh
[supervisord]
nodaemon=false
environment=HOME=/home/coder

[program:jupyterlab]
command=/usr/local/bin/jupyter lab --ip='*' --NotebookApp.token='' --NotebookApp.password=''
user=coder
directory=/home/coder
```

The third method to access JupyterLab is locally using the SSH port forward
command: `ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 coder.jupyterlab`. Alternatively, you can
use the Coder CLI to port forward using: `coder tunnel jupyterlab 8888 8888`.
Now, open a local  browser and navigate to `https://localhost:8888`.

## RStudio

Coder supports [RStudio](rstudio.com). To create a workspace that lets you use
RStudio:

1. Create a [custom image](../images/writing.md) with RStudio installed,
   `rserver` in `PATH`.

   To do this, you can refer to the sample Dockerfile below, which installs
   RStudio Server Open Source to log in with username `coder` and password
   `rstudio`.

   > This Dockerfile approach works now with latest versions of RStudio
   > including 2022-2-1.

   ```Dockerfile
   FROM codercom/enterprise-base:ubuntu

   USER root

   # Install dependencies
   RUN apt-get update && \
   DEBIAN_FRONTEND="noninteractive" apt-get install --yes \
   r-base \
   gdebi-core

   # Install RStudio
   RUN wget https://download2.rstudio.org/server/bionic/amd64/rstudio-server-2022.02.1-461-amd64.deb && \
   gdebi --non-interactive rstudio-server-2022.02.1-461-amd64.deb

   # Ensure rstudio files can be written to by the coder user.
   RUN chown -R coder:coder /var/lib/rstudio-server
   RUN echo "server-pid-file=/tmp/rstudio-server.pid" >> /etc/rstudio/rserver.conf
   RUN echo "server-data-dir=/tmp/rstudio" >> /etc/rstudio/rserver.conf
   RUN echo "www-frame-origin=same" >> /etc/rstudio/rserver.conf
   RUN echo "server-user=coder" >> /etc/rstudio/rserver.conf

   # Remove the following line if you do not run Coder on https
   RUN echo "server-add-header=X-Forwarded-Proto: https" >> /etc/rstudio/rserver.conf

   # Assign password "rstudio" to coder user.
   RUN echo 'coder:rstudio' | chpasswd

   # Assign locale
   RUN locale-gen en_US.UTF-8

   # Run as coder user
   USER coder

   # Add RStudio to path
   ENV PATH /usr/lib/rstudio-server/bin:${PATH}
   ```

1. [Create a workspace](getting-started.md#2-create-a-workspace) using the image
   you created in the previous step.

1. At this point, you can go to **Applications** to launch RStudio.

   ![Applications with RStudio launcher](../assets/workspaces/rstudio.png)

   Coder auto-signs in using the Unix user (whose username and password you
   defined in your custom image above).

   > RStudio may take a few additional seconds to start launch after the
   > workspace is built.
   >
   > All RStudio data is stored in the home directory associated with the user
   > you sign in as, since this ensures that your data is saved if Coder shuts
   > down or rebuilds your environment.

## Logging

You can find your IDE logs in the following places:

- For code-server: `~/.local/share/code-server/logs/`
- For JetBrains IDEs: `.cache/JetBrains/<JetBrains-IDE>/log/<IDE>.log`
